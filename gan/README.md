# Anomaly Detection using GAN
Using GANs to detect refugee boats. Based on https://github.com/houssamzenati/Adversarially-Learned-Anomaly-Detection and adjusted to work on the pipistrel bodensee dataset.

## Adversarially-Learned-Anomaly-Detection

### Prerequisites.
To run the code, follow those steps:

Download the project code:

```
git clone https://github.com/houssamzenati/Adversarially-Learned-Anomaly-Detection.git
```
Install requirements (in the cloned repository):

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


### Doing anomaly detection.

Running the code with different options

```
python3 main.py <model> <dataset> run --nb_epochs=<number_epochs> --label=<0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9> --m=<'cross-e','fm'> --d=<int> --rd=<int> etc. 
```
Please refer to the argument parser in main.py for more details.

When using alad, please use it with --sn, --enable_early_stop and --enable_dzz. (Different options are provided to enable the ablation study).
Important: we also provide implementations of DSEBM and DAGMM methods as open source work, the results reported in our paper for those methods, however, are derived from the DAGMM paper.
